## Sample script to run your IOM program on Slurm
## Assumes that you are running within a subfolder on /nfs 
## You can run it with: ./run_slurm.sh <input_file> <output_file> <number_of_threads>
##  and it will run your executable with those three arguments.

# Check that the three arguments were passed
if [ ! "$#" -eq 3 ]
then
  echo "Expecting 3 arguments (<input_file> <output_file> <number_of_threads>), got $#"
  exit 1
